      <description>As a student studying biology, I haven&#39;t dealt much with statistics but when I have, R Studio has been the language I learned to code in. However, in a course called &amp;quot;Computational Biology and Bioinformatics,&amp;quot; I&#39;ve been learning Python and one of the skills I have enjoyed practicing the most is reticulating Python with R.
