*As a student studying biology, I haven't dealt much with statistics but when I have, R Studio has been the language I learned to code in. However, in a course called "Computational Biology and Bioinformatics," I've been learning Python and one of the skills I have enjoyed practicing the most is reticulating Python with R.*

###Reticulating!
We can first call the "reticulate" package and define the first part of the text I wish to print. This is all done through an R chunk of code.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
retic<-"Wow! Look at them"
```

Next, I can use the same object to define it as the next part of the text and this is done through a chunk of Python code.
```{python}
retic="working together!"
print(r.retic,retic)
```

Finally, going back to using R code, I can access the Python-defined object and combine both parts of the full text together, even though they were defined using two different language types!
```{r}
cat(c(retic,py$retic))
```

*So cool, but even cooler are these Australian sheppard puppies! Please enjoy.*
